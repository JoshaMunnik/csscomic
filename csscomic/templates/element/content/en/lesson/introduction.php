    Welcome to the first lesson.

  <p>
    HTML code is plain text without any styling. It consists of text and special codes that define the
    structure of a web page. To view HTML as a web page you need a browser app, such as the one
    you are using now. Because HTML is plain text, you can create HTML files with any text editor,
    such as Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac.

    With all lessons this page will have the same layout:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the bar above you can select a lesson with the dropdown on the left.
      Or you can use the buttons on the right to go to the next or previous lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
      The top-left always contains the explanatory text and exercises.
    </li>
    <li>
      The top-right shows examples and hints to help when entering HTML code.
    </li>
    <li>
      At the bottom-left is the code editor. If it has a blue border and you see a
      blinking <em>cursor</em> you can enter text in it. If not, click it first. After
      entering code you can press the <code>update</code> button or the <code>F9</code> key
      to process the HTML code.
    </li>
    <li>
      The bottom-right shows the output of the processed HTML code. With the buttons above the
      output you can zoom in and out. You can use the right-most button to let the output cover
      the whole page. Use the download button to download an HTML file from the output.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="cc-lesson__exercise-container">

      <strong>Exercise:</strong> Enter some words in the code editor and press the
      <code>update</code> button to see what happens. The entered text should appear
