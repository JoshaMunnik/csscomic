    Welcome to the first lesson. Before we dive into the world of HTML and CSS, we will briefly
    explain how these lesson pages are structured:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the bar above you can select a lesson with the dropdown on the left.
      Or you can use the buttons on the right to go to the next or previous lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
      The top-left always contains the explanatory text and exercises.
    </li>
    <li>
      The top-right shows examples and hints to help when entering HTML code.
    </li>
    <li>
      At the bottom-left is the code editor. If it has a blue border and you see a
      blinking <em>cursor</em> you can enter text in it. If not, click it first. After
      entering code you can press the <code>update</code> button or the <code>F9</code> key
      to process the HTML code.
    </li>
    <li>
      The bottom-right shows the output of the processed HTML code. With the buttons above the
      output you can zoom in and out. You can use the right-most button to let the output cover
      the whole page. Use the download button to download an HTML file from the output.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Click the <code>next lesson</code> button to start with the next lesson.
  </p>
