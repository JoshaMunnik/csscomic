    When you visit a web page with a browser app (like the one you are using now), it downloads
    the HTML data from the server and processes the data to display the web page.
  </p>
  <p>
    The browser can also open an HTML file that is stored on your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create HTML yourself you can use a simple text editor such as Notepad on Windows or
    TextEdit on Mac. HTML uses plain text without any formatting. HTML consists of a mix of text and
    special codes that determine the structure of a web page.
